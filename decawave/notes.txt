}


Preference rules:
	anch_53 - V good if avail, high weight

Heuristic:
	linearly interpolate each anch available to get position according to that anchor:
		find bottom and top distances and matching points
		calc distance between bottom and top points, if too far, use another point

	If anch_53 available, use that:
		get higher and lower dist measures and matching point numbers, pixel coordinates
